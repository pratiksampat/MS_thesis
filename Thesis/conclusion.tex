CATCloud is a first in class vertical CPU autoscaler that operates directly within the OS. It minimally instruments the scheduler to extract run and yield characteristics to model the application behavior. Operating in millisecond timescales, it uses simple techniques to recommend CPU limits and offers the ability to tune both quota and period of the CPU bandwidth controller. This unique approach enables CATCloud to optimize performance by achieving high degrees of performance for the lower CPU limits, thereby reducing operating costs for cloud-based applications.
